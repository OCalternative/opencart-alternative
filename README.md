Just, for anyone!

Everyone is invited to brainstorming, support requests and everything else - no bullying here:

It seems Opencart is doing everything it can, to shut the project down and move away from open-source.

Choose and try out different platforms, which are based on Opencart!

These are my favourites:

* https://github.com/copona/copona
* https://arastta.org
* http://www.abantecart.com

Some older projects, still active:

* https://github.com/opencart-ce/opencart-ce

Or just, another system:
